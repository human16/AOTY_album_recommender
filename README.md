# AOTY_album_recommender
Find your next favorite album using your [AOTY](https://www.albumoftheyear.org) profile 


## Functionality
The website will use two methods to create album recommendations for the user, while also having a slider to allow user to discover lesser known albums. The user will be allowed to choose which method they want to use for the recommendations, Collaborative filtering (seeing what people who had similar ratings to you loved with no regard to what the content or genre of the album is) and Content based filtering (based on the genres, artists, and ratings of albums). The user can combine the two methods to create a hybrid model that uses the best of both worlds.
